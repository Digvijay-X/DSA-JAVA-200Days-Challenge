# Java Loops Practice

This repository contains my practice codes for Java Loops (Flow Control).  
I studied different types of loops, their use cases, and also solved small problems to understand them better.

---

## Topics I Covered
1. Loops Basics  
2. while Loop  
3. Print numbers from 1 to 10  
4. Print numbers from 1 to n  
5. Sum of first N natural numbers  
6. for Loop  
7. Print Square pattern  
8. Print reverse of a number  
9. Reverse the given number  
10. do while Loop  
11. Break statement  
12. Question - break keyword  
13. Continue statement  
14. Question - continue keyword  
15. Check if a number is Prime or not

## What I Learned
- Difference between while, for, and do-while loops.  
- How to use break and continue statements inside loops.  
- How to create patterns using nested loops.  
- Logic building with loops (reverse number, prime number check).

## How to Run
1. Save the Java file (e.g. `LoopsBasics.java`).  
2. Open terminal/command prompt in the same folder.  
3. Compile using:  
   ```bash
   javac LoopsBasics.java
