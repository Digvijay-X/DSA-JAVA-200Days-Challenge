# My Java Practice
  
This is my small Java project where I tried out some basic topics I studied today. I wanted to practice and see how everything works together.  

## Topics I Learned and Practiced

Variables – int, double, char, boolean  
Data Types – byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean  
Comments – Single-line and multi-line  
Type Conversion – automatic conversion  
Type Casting – manual conversion  
Type Promotion – when small types change automatically in expressions  
Operators  
  - Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`  
  - Unary: `++`, `--`  
  - Assignment: `=`, `+=`, `-=`  
  - Relational: `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`  
  - Logical: `&&`, `||`, `!`  

 Code =

I wrote all the examples in code. I tried to include comments so I can remember everything.  

This project is mainly for me to practice Java basics and get more confident with coding.
