#  JAVA + DSA – Day 7 

Today I didn’t start any **new topic**, instead I focused on **revision** of my previous concepts.  
The main goal was to strengthen my understanding of **loops (for, while, do-while)** and improve my **logic building** skills.  


 
  What I Revised  
- `for loop`  
- `while loop`  
- `do-while loop`  
- `break` and `continue`
